# sfltagminigame
A Community Minigame on Sunflower Land based on Crow Chaser, but this time you dodge the Tagger.

There will be 1 Chaser chasing 10 Players. 

The Chaser will be chosen randomly, but having Infected Potion and Crumple Crown or Cattlegrim will grant the owner 1 guaranteed match as the Chaser every day (effects stack).

The gameplay for the Player is no different from the Crow Chaser minigame: You have 3 hearts, Common enemies to dodge, but this time around the Chaser will chase after you, and if the Chaser catches you, you lose all hearts as well as your precious SFL! Win SFL by surviving until time runs out.

As the Chaser, you catch Players until time runs out. Common enemies won't hurt you, so you can pass through them without hassle.

Sometimes crops will be scavenged along the way for both the Players and Chaser to pick up.

Every participant will each pay an equal amount of SFL to play a match.

If each player deposits 1 SFL per match, the rewards will be distributed as following:

The Chaser earns 0.4 SFL per Player caught. Catching the last Player grants 2 SFL bonus.

All 10 Players surviving: 1.05 SFL each
9 Players surviving: 1.1 SFL each
8 Players surviving: 1.15 SFL each
7 Players surviving: 1.2 SFL each
6 Players surviving: 1.3 SFL each
5 Players surviving: 1.4 SFL each
4 Players surviving: 1.5 SFL each
3 Players surviving: 1.75 SFL each
2 Players surviving: 2 SFL each
1 Player surviving: 3 SFL

If players deposit more or less per match, the distribution will follow the ratio above as well.

The Leftover SFL after the match will be paid to the Community Developers behind this project, a small portion of which may be burnt.
